👨‍💻 Hello, world!

CS👩‍💻 graduate who enjoys breaking problems down, building them back up, and shipping full-stack web apps along the way. I work mainly with the MERN stack, write a lot of C++, and care about clean structure more than clever hacks.🙇‍♀️

I like digging into how things work, from APIs and databases to memory, logic, and design choices. Most days you’ll find me coding, refactoring, or convincing myself that this time the bug is definitely gone.

Always building, always learning, occasionally over-engineering (on purpose).🫩
